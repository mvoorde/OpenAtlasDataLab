# OpenAtlasDataLab
This repository contains a notebook setup (python+ROOT) that allows to easily play around with the open Run-2 data from the ATLAS experiment. This repo is based on another repository that specifically focused on measuring the Z boson in data from Run 1 of the LHC. Use together with jupyter with python3+ROOT available, e.g. with Google Colab or via Docker image [cohm/pyroot-notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/cohm/pyroot-notebook).

## Instructions with Google Colab
Open the Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab, e.g [https://colab.research.google.com/github/cohm/OpenAtlasDataLab/blob/master/0-Python-Jupyter-Notebook-intro.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cohm/OpenAtlasDataLab/blob/master/0-Python-Jupyter-Notebook-intro.ipynb) (just replace `0-Python-Jupyter-Notebook-intro.ipynb` with the name of the notebook you want to run).

To execute the notebooks you need to copy them to your own Google Drive before you can run them (push "Copy to Drive" near the top of the page")

(Obs: you need a Google account to use Colab)

## Instructions with Docker
With Docker, start up the lab through running  
`docker run -p 3000:8080 kthatlas/opendatalab:SH2103`
and then going to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

This Docker image contains a snapshot of this repository, on top of [cohm/pyroot-notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/cohm/pyroot-notebook).
The jupyter server is started when the image is run, and one can start working with the notebooks via a web browser. If you don't have access to a computer with Docker installed, you can use it in free four-hour sessions via [Play With Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/)..
